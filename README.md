# Responsive Portfolio Verison 2

This project consisted of creating a responsive and mobile design. This was to ensure that the website application can render according to a userâ€™s screen size whether that be on computer or phone. By using Bootstrap CSS Framework and the grid system along with HTML, we can deploy an application suitable for small and/or larger screens.

As an ongoing learning coder, my task was to update my current portfolio page and other included materials thus building towards being employer-competitive.
