# Responsive Portfolio


This project consists of creating a responsive and mobile first design. This is to ensure that website applications can render according to a userâ€™s screen size whether that be on computer or phone. By using Bootstrap CSS Framework and the grid system along with HTML, we can deploy an application suitable for small and/or larger screens.
